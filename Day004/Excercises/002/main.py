"""
You are going to write a program which will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.

Line 8 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. For this to work, you must enter all the names as name followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name
